# Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis

# Introduction

Sentiment analysis refers to identifying as well as classifying the sentiments that are expressed in the text source. Tweets are often useful in generating a vast amount of sentiment data upon analysis. These data are useful in understanding the opinion of the people about a variety of topics.
In this project, we aim to analyze the sentiment of the tweets provided from the Sentiment140 dataset by developing a machine learning pipeline involving the use of three classifiers (Logistic Regression, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, and SVM) along with using Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). The performance of these classifiers is then evaluated using accuracy.

# Problem Statement

In this project, we try to implement a Twitter sentiment analysis model that helps to overcome the challenges of identifying the sentiments of the tweets.
The various steps involved in the Machine Learning Pipeline are :
1. Import Necessary Dependencies
2. Read and Load the Dataset
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Data Visualization of Target Variables
5. Data Preprocessing
6. Splitting our data into Train and Test Subset
7. Transforming Dataset using TF-IDF Vectorizer
8. Function for Model Evaluation
9. Model Building


# Dataset

The dataset provided is the Sentiment140 Dataset which consists of 1,600,000 tweets that have been extracted using the Twitter API.
